## Mobile Design Principles

### Mobile-First Approach
All designs start with the mobile version and expand to larger screens, ensuring:
- Core functionality is optimized for touch and smaller screens
- Content prioritization for limited viewport space
- Performance considerations for varying network conditions

### Touch Optimization
- Minimum touch target size of 44x44px for all interactive elements
- 8-12px spacing between interactive elements to prevent accidental taps
- Primary actions within thumb reach zone
- Swipe gestures for natural interactions like page turning

### Responsive Behaviors
- **Stack** - Multi-column layouts stack vertically on mobile
- **Simplify** - Complex components have simplified mobile versions
- **Prioritize** - Only essential content visible initially on mobile
- **Adapt** - Navigation changes from horizontal to bottom bar or menu

### Mobile-Specific Components
- **Bottom Sheet** - For additional options without leaving the current context
- **Floating Action Button** - For primary creation actions
- **Pull-to-Refresh** - For content updates
- **Swipeable Cards** - For book preview navigation

### Special Considerations
- Support for device orientation changes
- Handling of keyboard appearance and virtual keyboard space
- Optimization for various notch designs and safe areas
- Consistent behavior during interruptions (calls, notifications)

- Design hover states that don't require precise pointer control
- Provide adequate time for user responses

### Content Structure
